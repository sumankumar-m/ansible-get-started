# Ansible Playbook - My First Playbook

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find an example of a basic Ansible playbook. This playbook creates a directory, writes a file into it, and displays the content of the file with the current timestamp.

Ansible playbooks are YAML files that define a set of tasks to be executed on remote or local hosts. This specific playbook demonstrates how to:

- Define and use variables in an Ansible playbook.
- Create directories and files using the `file` and `copy` modules.
- Use the `debug` module to display dynamic content.

## Prerequisites

Before running the playbook, ensure that you have the following:

- Ansible installed on your local machine. If not, you can follow the [Ansible installation guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html).

## Playbook Code

Create a new file `first_playbook.yml` in your `/home/lab/project/` directory and add the following content:

```yaml
---
- name: My First Playbook
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  vars:
    dir_path: /home/lab/project/test_directory
    file_content: "Hello from Ansible! The time is {{ ansible_date_time.iso8601 }}"

  tasks:
    - name: Create a directory
      file:
        path: "{{ dir_path }}"
        state: directory
        mode: "0755"

    - name: Create a file
      copy:
        content: "{{ file_content }}"
        dest: "{{ dir_path }}/hello.txt"

    - name: Display file content
      debug:
        msg: "The content of the file is: {{ file_content }}"
```

### Breakdown of Playbook

1. **YAML Structure**: The playbook begins with `---` which marks the start of the YAML document.
2. **Name**: `My First Playbook` is a description of the playbook's purpose.
3. **Hosts**: `localhost` specifies that this playbook will run on the local machine. In real-world scenarios, you may define remote hosts or groups.
4. **Connection**: `local` tells Ansible to execute the playbook locally instead of through SSH.
5. **Variables**: 
   - `dir_path`: Path to the directory to be created.
   - `file_content`: Content of the file, which includes a timestamp.
6. **Tasks**:
   - **Create Directory**: Uses the `file` module to create a directory at the specified path with the desired permissions.
   - **Create File**: Uses the `copy` module to write the specified content into a file.
   - **Display File Content**: Uses the `debug` module to output the content of the file to the console.

## Running the Playbook

To run the playbook, execute the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook /home/lab/project/first_playbook.yml
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
PLAY [My First Playbook] ******************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Create a directory] ******************************************************
changed: [localhost]

TASK [Create a file] ***********************************************************
changed: [localhost]

TASK [Display file content] ****************************************************
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": "The content of the file is: Hello from Ansible! The time is 2023-06-09T12:34:56Z"
}

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=4    changed=1    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
```

- The **"changed"** status indicates that the directory and file were successfully created.
- The **"msg"** field in the output of the debug task will display the file content along with the current timestamp.

## Verifying the Results

To verify that the directory and file were created, use the following commands:

```bash
ls -l /home/lab/project/test_directory
cat /home/lab/project/test_directory/hello.txt
```

- The `ls` command will list the contents of the `test_directory`.
- The `cat` command will display the content of the `hello.txt` file.

## Key Takeaways

- **YAML Format**: Ansible playbooks use YAML format to define automation tasks.
- **Variables**: Variables can make your playbook more flexible by allowing easy changes to paths, file contents, and other values.
- **Modules**: In this example, we used the `file`, `copy`, and `debug` modules. Ansible has many modules for different tasks, and you can use them to perform almost any system management task.
- **Task Execution**: Each task in the playbook is executed in order, and Ansible will report on the results after each task completes.

## Conclusion

This lab demonstrated how to create and execute a basic Ansible playbook. You learned about the key elements of playbooks, including variables, tasks, and modules. You also saw how to use Ansibleâ€™s debug module to output dynamic information during playbook execution. 

As you progress with Ansible, playbooks will become a key tool in automating complex infrastructure tasks. Experiment with modifying the playbook, adding new tasks, or exploring more Ansible modules to gain further experience.

## Next Steps

- Experiment with adding more tasks to the playbook.
- Explore other Ansible modules such as `yum`, `apt`, `service`, `template`, and `shell` for different types of system management tasks.
- Learn about playbook roles, conditionals, and loops for more advanced automation.
